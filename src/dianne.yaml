Hello Senator {{senator}}, 
 
My name is {{name}} and I am calling on you from {{city}}, CA.
    
Azerbaijan and Turkey are attacking democratic Armenia and Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh), and full-fledged war is being waged against the Armenian people, a people that survived genocide during WW1. Armenian civilians are being murdered and removed from their lands, and their existence is once again in grave danger.  Turkey and Azerbaijan are bombing civilians and have brought Jihadist terrorists to fight against the Armenian people. We are at dire risk of experiencing and witnessing a second genocide against the Armenian people.  Turkeyâ€™s president has also alluded to invading Jerusalem.  To avoid this conflict becoming a drawn-out regional and international catastrophe and genocide, you need to act right now.
    
I am calling on you to:

1.	Publicly, through ALL social media platforms, condemn Azerbaijani and Turkish attacks on Artsakh and Armenia;

2.	Publicly, through ALL social media platforms, recognize the independence of Artsakh;

3.	Explicitly call for immediately halting ALL U.S. military and financial aid to the anti-American, anti-Armenian, and anti-Israeli dictatorships of Azerbaijan and Turkey;

4.	Introduce a legislative bill to end the Section 907 waiver of the Freedom Support Act in order to completely terminate any U.S. military and financial aid and exports to Azerbaijan;

5.	Call for the immediate enforcement of the Magnitsky Act sanctions against Erdogan, Aliyev, and all other government officials of Turkey and Azerbaijan; and

6.	Introduce a legislative bill with immediate crippling sanctions against Turkey and Azerbaijan in order to deploy tangible and decisive pressures that will force a halt in attacks and crimes against humanity committed on the people of Artsakh and Armenia.
    
Turkey and Azerbaijan have been committing human rights violations dropping cluster bombs on civilians for days now and I have not seen any effective legislative action from you.  I suggest you act with the utmost urgency to rectify this egregious oversight.  
    
It is critical for you to note that I am registered to vote and ready to make myself heard through my vote. Your actions regarding this immediate issue will absolutely play a deciding role during your re-election efforts in 2024.
    
Thank you.

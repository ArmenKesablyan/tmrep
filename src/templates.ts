Hello Congressman ${p.rep}, 
<br /><br />
My name is ${p.name} and I am calling on you from ${p.city}, CA.
<br /><br />
Azerbaijan and Turkey are attacking democratic Armenia and Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh), and full-fledged war is being waged against the Armenian people. The Armenian people have already survived one genocide during WW1.  In a renewed effort by Turkey and Azerbaijan, Armenian civilians are being murdered and removed from their lands, and their existence is once again in grave danger.  As documented by Amnesty International, Turkey and Azerbaijan are committing human rights violations against the civilians of Armenia and Artsakh by bombing civilians using illegal weapons and recruiting known Jihadist terrorists to fight against the Armenian people.  We are at dire risk of experiencing and witnessing a second genocide against the Armenian people.  
<br /><br />
Turkey’s president has also stated his intention to invade Jerusalem.  To avoid this conflict becoming a drawn-out regional catastrophe you need to act right now.
<br /><br />
I am demanding for you to immediately:
<br /><br />
1.	Publicly, through ALL social media platforms, condemn Azerbaijani and Turkish attacks on Artsakh and Armenia;
<br /><br />
2.	Publicly, through ALL social media platforms, recognize the independence of Artsakh;
<br /><br />
3.	Explicitly call for immediately halting ALL U.S. military and financial aid to the anti-American, anti-Armenian, and anti-Israeli dictatorships of Azerbaijan and Turkey;
<br /><br />
4.	Vote for Congressman Frank Pallone’s resolution to recognize the independence of Artsakh;
<br /><br />
5.	Introduce a legislative bill to end the Section 907 waiver of the Freedom Support Act in order to completely terminate any U.S. military and financial aid and exports to Azerbaijan;
<br /><br />
6.	Introduce a legislative bill to enforce Magnitsky Act sanctions against Turkish Dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, and Turkish Chief of General Staff Yasar Güler for aiding and abetting the commission of human rights violations using illegal weapons and known terrorists against the civilians of Artsakh and Armenia, as documented by Amnesty International; 
<br /><br />
7.	Introduce a legislative bill to enforce Section 116(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and halt all assistance to the government of Azerbaijan due to the consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, including torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment by the use of illegal cluster munitions on civilians, and death by firing squad, beheadings and skinning of Armenian and Artsakh soldiers;
<br /><br />
8.	Introduce a legislative bill to enforce Magnitsky Act sanctions against Azerbaijani Dictator Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijani Defense Minister Zakir Hasanov, Azerbaijani Chief of General Staff Najmeddin Sadikov Huseynoglu, Azerbaijani Deputy Minister of Defense (Army) Mustafayev Kerem Narimanoglu, and Azerbaijani Deputy Minister of Defense (Air Force) Tairov Ramiz Firudinoglu Güler for committing human rights violations using illegal weapons and known terrorists against the civilians of Artsakh and Armenia, as documented by Amnesty International; 
<br /><br />
9.	Introduce a legislative bill with immediate crippling economic sanctions against Turkey and Azerbaijan in order to deploy tangible and decisive pressures that will force a halt in attacks and crimes against humanity committed on the civilians of Artsakh and Armenia; and
<br /><br />
10.	Introduce a legislative bill to initiate an arms embargo on Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Belarus.
<br /><br />
Turkey and Azerbaijan have been committing human rights violations dropping cluster bombs on civilians for almost a month now. I have not seen any real or effective legislative action from you.  I suggest you act with the utmost urgency to rectify this reckless and egregious oversight.  
<br /><br />
It is critical for you to note that I am registered to vote and ready to make myself heard through my vote. Your actions regarding this immediate issue will absolutely be a deciding factor during your upcoming election and your potential re-election efforts in 2022.
<br /><br />
Thank you.

Finally, I am expecting to see you immediately call for crippling sanctions against Turkey and Azerbaijan in order to deploy tangible pressures onto Turkey and Azerbaijan to force a halt in attacks against Artsakh and Armenia.

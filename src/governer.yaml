Hello Governor {{governor}}, 
 
My name is {{name}} and I am calling on you from {{city}}, CA.
    
Azerbaijan and Turkey are attacking democratic Armenia and Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh), and full-fledged war is being waged against the Armenian people, a people that survived genocide during WW1. Armenian civilians are being murdered and removed from their lands, and their existence is once again in grave danger.  Turkey and Azerbaijan are bombing civilians and have brought Jihadist terrorists to fight against the Armenian people. We are at dire risk of experiencing and witnessing a second genocide against the Armenian people.  Turkeyâ€™s president has also alluded to invading Jerusalem.  To avoid this conflict becoming a drawn-out regional catastrophe you need to act right now.
    
I am calling on you to demand that you publicly, through ALL social media platforms, condemn Azerbaijani and Turkish attacks and explicitly call for immediately stopping ALL U.S. military aid to the anti-American, anti-Armenian, and anti-Israeli dictatorships in Azerbaijan and Turkey.
    
I am calling on you, and the state of California, to publicly recognize Artsakh's independence through ALL social media platforms and through official proclamation.
    
Finally, I am expecting to see you immediately call for crippling sanctions against Turkey and Azerbaijan in order to deploy tangible pressures onto Turkey and Azerbaijan to force a halt in attacks against Artsakh and Armenia.  
    
Turkey and Azerbaijan have been committing human rights violations dropping cluster bombs on civilians for days now and I have not seen any legislative action from you.  I suggest you act with the utmost urgency to rectify this egregious oversight.   
    
It is critical for you to note that I am registered to vote and ready to make myself heard through my vote. Your actions regarding this immediate issue will absolutely play a deciding role during your 2022 election.
    
Thank you."

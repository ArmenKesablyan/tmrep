Turkey are attacking democratic Armenia and Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh), and full-fledged war is being waged against the Armenian people. The Armenian people have already survived one genocide during WW1.  In a renewed effort by Turkey and Azerbaijan, Armenian civilians are being murdered and removed from their lands, and their existence is once again in grave danger.  As documented by Amnesty International, Turkey and Azerbaijan are committing human rights violations against the civilians of Armenia and Artsakh by bombing civilians using illegal weapons and recruiting known Jihadist terrorists to fight against the Armenian people.  We are at dire risk of experiencing and witnessing a second genocide against the Armenian people.  \n<br /><br />\nTurkey’s president has also stated his intention to invade Jerusalem.
